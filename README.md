# TabSummarizer üóÇÔ∏è

**Turn tab chaos into clear insights, instantly and offline.**

A Chrome Extension that clusters and summarizes browser tabs using Chrome's built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano + Summarizer/Prompt/Rewriter APIs). Perfect for researchers, students, and productivity enthusiasts who struggle with information overload from too many open tabs.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Tab Summarization**: Automatically summarize each tab into 2-3 sentences using Chrome's Summarizer API
- **Improved Tab Titles**: Rewrite confusing tab titles with clearer, more descriptive ones using the Rewriter API
- **Natural Language Queries**: Use multimodal queries like "show me all articles with charts/images about AI" with the Prompt API
- **Advanced Tab Clustering**: Group similar tabs using cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization for intelligent organization
- **Export to Markdown**: Save organized tab summaries to Markdown files for note-taking and research
- **Offline-First**: Runs entirely locally using Chrome's built-in AI - no server round-trips needed
- **Real-Time Processing**: Automatically processes tabs as you browse with intelligent caching
- **Beautiful Interface**: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations and accessibility features

## üéØ Problem Solved

Too many open tabs = information overload. TabSummarizer solves this by:
- Reducing cognitive load through intelligent summarization
- Making tab titles meaningful and searchable
- Enabling natural language search across your browser tabs
- Working completely offline for privacy and speed
